In my high school and early university summers, I returned to my childhood summer camp as a camp counselor. There, I cared for groups of 8-14 year old kids and planned educational and engaging programs. As I became a senior counselor, I was put in charge of larger programs, often working with or leading groups of counselors for a successful day or evening. I could not fill my summers with enough of this challenging and gratifying job. Several years later, I was able to return to the camp as the head counselor, where I coordinated a team of over a dozen counselors. I learned not only how to manage people to make sure that programs happened, but I also gained valuable experience in fostering a culture of enthusiasm among the counselors and campers through example and instruction.
