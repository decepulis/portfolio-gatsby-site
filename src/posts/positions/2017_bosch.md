From January to August 2017, I worked at Bosch's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/bosch-officially-opens-new-research-campus-in-renningen-42977.html">Research Campus</a> near Stuttgart, Germany. I spent a most of that time designing and developing a research software suite for sensor data aggregation and analysis, implemented with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/">InfluxDB</a>, node.js, and modern web technologies. (I <i>love</i> sensors!) I was detail-obsessed as I built the suite ground-up to be modular and user-friendly; it had to be useful to as many different types of researchers with as many different types of sensors as possible. I also assisted in building experimental sensor platforms in Altium for PCB design and layout, and Solidworks for 3D-printing of PCB enclosures.

Through this time, I was able to further my professional competencies and contribute to Bosch's research through communicating with researchers&mdash;eliciting their requirements, and seeing these requirements through to finished applications (all while learning the requisite web technologies). Above all, though, I had the opportunity to live and learn and work in German with people from around the world.
