All Engineering Students at University of Cincinnati are required to take two semesters of Engineering Modelsâ€”an introduction to programming (in MATLAB). The concepts taught in this class are useful for all majors, not only because programming is a cross-disciplinary tool, but also because learning programming encourages the kind of critical thinking that's necessary to breaking down Engineering problems. As a TA for this class, I've worked with students from diverse backgrounds as they begin their journey in Engineering, working with them in two hour weekly labs to understand the challenge of the week, or to understand the fundamentals of programming. No matter what, the eight hours a week I spent as a TA in lab have been bright ones.
