January&ndash;April and September&ndash;December of 2015, I worked at the [Information Technology Research Center](https://www.bmwusfactory.com/manufacturing/building-a-better-bmw/information-technology-research-center/), near the BMW Manufacturing plant, in Greenville, South Carolina. There, I assisted my department's effort to investigate applications of emerging technologies in manufacturing. The department's main focus during my time there was Big Data.

To that end, I worked with automobile inspectors to develop and deploy an iOS application that saved each inspector over an hour a day, while providing us with training data for models. Upon completion, the application was presented to the BMW Board of Directors. I autonomously scheduled meetings with managers and inspectors to elicit requirements and give updates, designed the application to meet the requirements of the inspectors and my department, conducted training, acquired and deployed hardware, and supported the application in production.

Before this, I also supported the development and coordinated training and trials for an experimental [Google Glass application](http://www.bmwblog.com/2014/11/19/bmw-visual-inspection-memory-function-via-google-glass/) that assisted in automobile inspections, and supported [a research project](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/04/bmw-3d-prints-new-thumbs-for-factory-workers) which would help line workers who were suffering from repetitive strain injury with 3D-printed customized braces. Between major projects, I explored building 3D environments, used for inspections or virtual tours, with photographs taken by quadcopters and a custom-built raspberry pi-based [ballbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballbot). Alongside this, I prepared large training datasets with Shell and Python.

With all of these concurrent projects over the course of eight months, I also had significant experience in managing my time and utilizing my resources to meet parallel demands. Furthermore, all of the technologies I encountered in my time at BMW were new to me, and I demonstrated that I was capable of quick learning, and that I was able to apply my existing skills to new fields.
