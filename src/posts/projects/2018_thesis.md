In my thesis, titled "Creating Socio-Technical Patches for Information Foraging - A Requirements Traceability Case Study", I explored applications of [Information Foraging Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_foraging). We hunt for information in the exact same way that we've evolved to hunt for food. How long do we spend in one place before we move on? How do we estimate how much food that place will have? If we understand that human behavior better, maybe we can make the Software Engineering process better. Can we make developing more efficient by making good information easier to reach, identify, and navigate?

Within information foraging theory, I'm currently focusing on foraging in socio-technical environments. It's hard to answer questions in environments that have both information artifacts and people; one must consider both the relationships between information and the relationships between people when seeking answers. For example: let's say I just saw the movie Interstellar and I'm looking for more moves I'd like. We could recommend Gravity, or Star Wars, or The Martian, too. But despite being sci-fi, they're all quite different movies. What happens, though, if we add a human element? Christopher Nolan directed Interstellar. That connects me to The Dark Knight and Dunkirk&mdash;now different genres, but still movies I loved for the craft and scale that Christopher Nolan brings. By adding a human element to our graph, among other elements to make it heterogeneous, we suddenly have more nuanced information foraging.

With the indispensible guidance of my advisor, and quite a few late nights, I was able to submit the core work of my thesis to IEEE's Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing Conference (VL/HCC) in April of 2018, four months after beginning work. Incredibly, it was [accepted](http://vlhcc18.github.io/accepted_papers.html)! I had a fantastic experience [traveling](https://www.instagram.com/p/BoaEUbPH8Zv/?taken-by=dardarb1nks) [to](https://www.instagram.com/p/BofZdvKnExe/?taken-by=dardarb1nks) [Lisbon](https://www.instagram.com/p/BoeQUDAH_uS/?taken-by=dardarb1nks), and presenting my work to [the conference](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8488603) while learning all about the world of Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing.

Image: The work which formed my thesis consistedof two parts: creating graphs from socio-technical environments, and assigning weights to each node in the graph (where a weight represents a node's relevance to a user's question in that environment). You can see one of these networks here, where the intensity of red in each node represents its weight.
