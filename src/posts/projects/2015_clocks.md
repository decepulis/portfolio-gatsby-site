I thought I'd solved the yearly struggle of coming up with an individualized thoughtful Christmas present for everyone in the family pretty nicely in 2015! For my Lithuanian family, I made clocks, based off of individually-addressable LEDs (I have an obsession with lighting) driven by an Arduino, which spell out the time in plain English&mdash;er&mdash;Lithuanian. "It is 12 'o clock".

<img src="/img/projects-clock.jpg" alt="A thick picture frame, except inside is a word clock. Words and numbers are aranged in rows in the frame. The words illuminated are Lithuanian: 'yra 12 valand', which translates to 'it is 12'o'clock.'">
