Inspired by an [awesome project](http://quantifiedselfie.us) I saw online, I decided to analyze six years of Facebook messages and SMS in order to not only practice data analytics in Python, but also to gain interesting insights on my relationships. The project involved scrubbing HTML, storing data in useful data structures, and manipulating and plotting the data using NumPy and Bokeh in Python.
