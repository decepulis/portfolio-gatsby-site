Hobby Electronics: my comfort zone. Arduinos and Raspberry Pis have always been my favorite toys at home. And then, ever since buying a set of Philips Hue lights, I've been trying to automate <emph>everything</emph> by hooking it up to Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/home/">HomeKit</a> smart home control system. Finally, as anyone who has ever lived with me can attest, I have a thing about lighting. I will spend a whole afternoon trying to get the right color, intensity, and accent lighting in a room. This leads me to this project: an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266">ESP8266</a>-controlled RGB light strip.

The motive of this project, besides having another fun and cool light source, was to get to know the ESP8266, which promises to enable extremely inexpensive homemade smart home appliances. And "inexpensive" is a key word here! Inspired by <a href="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/10-diy-wifi-rgb-led-mood-light-with-esp8266-step-by-step/">another project</a>, I assembled my BOM mostly from eBay for about \$20:

- \$6.30 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IK9GEQG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">NodeMCU ESP8266 ESP-12E Board</a> (chosen for its accessibility for ESP8266 beginners)
- \$2.50 <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/1x-10x-LM2596S-DC-DC-3A-Buck-Adjustable-Step-down-Power-Supply-Converter-Module/332711109230?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&var=541841219942&_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649">LM2596 DC-DC Buck Adjustable Step-Down Power Supply Converter</a> (to drop the LED's 12V to the 5V that the NodeMCU requires)
- \$11.95 <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/5M-RGB-5050-Waterproof-LED-Strip-light-SMD-44-Key-Remote-12V-US-Power-Full-Kit/302383732527?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649">5M RGB 5050 Waterproof LED Strip</a>
- 3x 2N2222 NPN Transistors
- 3x 1kohm Resistors
- Wiring, Soldering essentials

After remembering how transistors work and assembling and testing the circuit with some simple <a href="https://github.com/decepulis/SMD5050-Homebridge/blob/master/experiments/RGB5050_local/RGB5050_local.ino">offline Arduino code</a>, the time came to connect the circuit to HomeKit... Luckily, there was no need to re-invent the wheel on this one, as it had been done before. (I'm not claiming this is novel work!) While I considered connecting the ESP8266 to an <a href="http://supersimo88.altervista.org/homekit-philips-hue-clone-with-standard-non-addressable-rgb-strip-and-esp8266/">MQTT Server</a> that could communicate with HomeKit, or even <a href="https://github.com/HomeACcessoryKid/ESP8266-HomeKit">connecting directly</a>, ultimately I decided to find a solution that relied on <a href="https://github.com/HomeACcessoryKid/ESP8266-HomeKit">homebridge</a>, a wonderful open-source project that runs on a server and looks like a HomeKit hub to Apple devices, which I already had running in my home. And, I even found a <a href="https://www.esp8266.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=12259">great guide</a> which provided both functioning Arduino code to run on the ESP8266, and configuration for a homebridge module. Finally, I went ahead and <a href="https://github.com/decepulis/SMD5050-Homebridge/blob/master/SMD5050-Homebridge.ino">rewrote the Arduino Code</a> so that switching between colors would have a nice transition, and made some changes to the <a href="https://github.com/decepulis/SMD5050-Homebridge/blob/master/config.json">config.json</a> in order to work with the latest version of the homebridge module.

After an afternoon of bug-fixing (you'll notice, in the video below, things like White having a wild HEX value in the serial output thanks to a bug in my brightness-parsing code), I stuck all the components into a project box (may the gods of soldering, electrical tape, and hot glue please forgive me) and gave it a good stress test. Success.
