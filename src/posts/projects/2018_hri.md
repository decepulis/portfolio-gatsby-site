Maybe I should have gone into Psychology, for Human Factors. Don't get me wrong&mdash;I _love_ problem solving with computers. But figuring out human problems is just as fun to me as building an app or gizmo. I first had an inkling of this when I had the wonderful challenge of designing UI/UX for non-technical users of my app. How do they think the app should work, and what visual cues could I provide, incorporating those expectations, so that the user could accomplish their tasks? In Human-Robot Interaction, I had a semester of an in-depth look at how people think, and how we should design robots around those thoughts.

In this class's final project, we were tasked with designing a Human-Robot interaction study, to test how humans react to some element within robotics. To substantially lighten physical, monetary, and safety concerns, we decided to conduct a trial in Virtual Reality. Within a VR environment, programmed in Unity, we had our subjects pass a ball to a humanoid robot arm and a non-humanoid robot arm. We were testing to see if the appearance of the robot would affect the passing task (with the hypothesis that our subjects would more-confidently pass the ball to the humanoid robot).

How did it go? Well, not that well. At the end of the semester, there were only so many underclassmen who weren't furiously studying for exams that we could conscript for our test. With a sample size of 16, we didn't have the statistical power to say anything for certain. Aside from that, our [Godspeed Questionnaire](http://www.bartneck.de/publications/2009/measurementInstrumentsRobots/) indicated that perhaps the difference between our humanoid and non-humanoid models wasn't good enough. Is it something we could publish? Heck no. But I learned so much about conducting a human trials, and indeed, Human-Robot Interaction.
