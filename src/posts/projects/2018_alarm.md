"Anything?"

"Yes, as long as you gain experience with Embedded Systems."

Such was the directive that launched our Embedded Systems project, which set out to automatically make coffee using a _real_ brew method (we chose pour-over) and to wake a user up. Controlled by Arduino, the hand-stained wooden programmable digital clock will boil water, pour into a wire-mesh pour over, and ring a large call bell with a servo until you press the big, glowing "OFF" button.

<img src="/img/projects-coffee.jpg" alt="A wooden L shape. On the tall part of the L is a water boiler, held up by wood over a pour-over coffee filter. Below the filter, a ceramic cup to catch the coffee. Behind the tall part, wiring and circuitry is visible. On the bottom of the L, in the middle, is a digital clock, not currently showing the time. Above the clock are buttons to operate the clock. Finally, at the end of the bottom is a big call bell with a thin wooden arm held up above it. I can tell you personally that this call-bell provides a loud awakening.">
