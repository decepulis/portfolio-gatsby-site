  Understanding color theory and accessibility to generate color schemes in
  Javascript and CSS

Rad was an exploration of two concepts: how can I generate pleasing color palettes, and how can I ensure they remain accessible? The most robust solution ended up being pretty boring: don't go reinventing the (color) wheel&mdash;use well-established color relationships like complementary colors or triads&mdash;and use either light colors with dark text, or dark colors with light text. Let me take you through the journey to get to that answer, though.

## The Color Wheel

First, how does one randomly generate color palettes? Turns out that I learned the answer years ago, in Mrs. Centa's Grade 4 art class: use the color wheel! Many [others](http://www.worqx.com/color/combinations.htm) can explain color combinations on the color wheel better than I can. If you don't know, though, I'll give you the short story: colors a certain distance away from each other look good with each other. Complementary colors are 180° away from each other on the color wheel. Monochromatic colors are all in the same degree; they just vary in brightness and saturation. Analogous colors are all adjacent. Because I wanted three colors&mdash;one for the site background, one for the headers, and one for body text&mdash;I ended up exploring two other relationships: split-complementary and triads.

### Split-Complementary Colors

Split-complementary color schemes are pretty simple: pick two complementary colors, and then replace one of them with two colors on either side. Doing this in JavaScript and CSS was pretty simple: pick a random number between 0 and 360, pick two +/- 20°‚ away, and pick one 180° away. CSS already supports expressing colors in degrees through `hsl()`, so I just set a CSS variable through JavaScript. Bam. Pretty website.

```javascript
```

I actually had a variant of this [implemented](https://5d51ca39a2afe30009393cc6--jovial-engelbart-1fa19d.netlify.com) in an early version and really liked it! That version used the -20 hue for H1 and H2, the +20 hue for H3&ndash;H6, and the 0 hue for body text. But then I got distracted by triads.

### Triads and Issues

Triads are a color relationship in which all three colors are equidistant on the color wheel. A responsible triad might mute two of the colors and use one as an accent. But I was feeling_rad_so I ramped them all up! And quickly ran into an obstacle: no matter if I set the color to black or white, some text remained unreadable.

When I saw this problem before, in the code quoted above, I simply darkened the colors and lightened the background until the [Firefox Accessibility Inspector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Accessibility_inspector) told me that I had enough contrast. However, I wanted bright, saturated,\_rad_colors. While maintaining readable text. It took me three solutions to get to the bottom of that.

## Accessible Text on Randomly Generated Colors

### The 'L' in 'HSL'

My first attempt to get readable text on_rad_colors was to simply set text color to black if the 'l' in 'hsl' was >50%, and white if not. Seems great, right? Nope. Here's white text on a 50% yellow (same picture as above!), and on a 50% blue.

So, despite having the same 50% lightness value, the yellow_appears_a lot brighter than the blue. What gives?
