- <a href="/files/Darius Cepulis Graduate.pdf">Unofficial Transcript</a>

While diving deeper with my coursework into the fields that Computer Science has to offer (from Vulnerability Assessment to Human-Robot Interaction) I was also conducting research with <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ag81t_4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Dr. Nan Niu</a> on Information Foraging Theory. You can read more about my thesis in the Projects section. The thesis was adapted from my submission to IEEE's VL/HCC 2018. That submission <a target="_blank" href="http://vlhcc18.github.io/accepted_papers.html"> was accepted</a> and presented in October 2018 in Lisbon, Portugal.
