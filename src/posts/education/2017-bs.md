The most impactful part of my undergraduate experience was alternating academic and co-op semesters. It's one thing to immerse myself in the fields of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in a classroom. It's another to work for five semesters, applying that coursework and finding out what kind work I'd truly be passionate about.
